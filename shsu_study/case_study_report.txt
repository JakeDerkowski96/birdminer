                    BIRDMINER: TWITTER DATA MINING AND REPORTING
                           CREATED BY:  JAKE DERKOWSKI
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                    INTRODUCTION
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Birdminer is a user-configurable program that allows the user to configure the
    way in which they would like to mine Twitter data. BirdMiner's different modes
    give the user efficiency for all search configurations; for all the parameters.

    This mode "birdminer.py --mode shsu" does not allow for configuration. Instead,
    it performs, conducts, and reports a case study on Sam Houston State University
    entirely on its own. For the conservation of computing power, the parameters in
    are reduced to allow for easy testing and presentation of the power Birdminer
    has.

    This case study shows the frequency in which students' posts contain keywords
    that indicate that they are "partying", or using drugs and/or drinking, and will
    be used to give a percentage approximation of the students that also partake in
    similar behaviors.

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                        BACKGROUND INFORMATION/DATA COLLECTION
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    There are only two search functions that collects all of the data that is user
    in this study. The main function that collects all of the raw data uses global
    positioning system (GPS) coordinates of Sam Houston State University as a focal
    point, then scraps all tweets posted during the 2019 spring semester that were
    posted within a 3 kilometer radius. This may limit the scope for BirdMiner by
    excluding those who commute to campus; however, it also returns a sample that is
    more concentrated of users that are actually students by capturing all of the
    tweets that were made on or near campus. This radius of searching is far more
    in- clusive then it initially sounds.

    This radius was calculated based on the distances from student living apartment
    complexes to campus. The distance from the Gateway apartments to campus was used
    in calculating the radius because this is the complex that is the furthest from
    campus but still provides a shuttle. This distance is 2.89km -- for simplicity
    the we use the rounded 3 kilometers.

    Sam Houston students (including those in graduate programs) equal to 20,938 -
    therefore, represent approximately 54.2% of Huntsville's population (38,548).
    With the given radius, the data collected should be primarily Sam Houston State
    students because most live near campus, and make up most of the population of
    the city.

    The data can also be further verified by the second function used by Birdminer.
    Birdminer export all of the data that was initially collected into a Database
    'birdminer.db' which stores all of the data in an organized and secure fashion
    (all data used in analysis will be drawn from this database). Birdminer selects
    all of the distinct users from the 'users' table and exports the list to a csv
    which the second function loops through and mines data for each user and then
    stored into the 'users' table. Queries executed on this table provides more
    certainty in verifying a user, but this will not be done for this program. This
    is not necessary because it has been shown that the data collected is reliable
    and this function takes a considerable amount of time to run. ***THIS FUNCTION
    DOES NOT RUN AUTOMATICALLY -- MUST BE UNCOMMENTED***


    Included within this directory will be the completed database file that
    Birdminer created, so mining has to be done to test this program. However, the
    results of a new search can possibly present different data analysis because
    data may removed/ added to twitter since time of original mining.
