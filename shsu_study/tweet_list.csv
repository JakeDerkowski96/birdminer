There’s no timeline on your life. Things will happen when they’re supposed to. People will come into our lives when we are ready for them to. Everything will fall into place when it’s meant to. Remember that.

Tyson Simmons and Eric Monroy had a great year. Tyson Simmons was Fourth in Discus with 134’3 and Eric Monroy was third in 3200 with a pr of 9:59. He has a shot at the at large bid for state. We are awaiting other regionals results. Stay tuned. pic.twitter.com/jBlS5dpy2D – at Bowers Stadium

How in Gods name is this talent ? That’s the equivalent of acting like cutting someone off while driving your car to make them hit you is just great defensive driving.
He can just score the ball...He’s James harden. the dude is trying to purposely flop for contact by extending his legs into a defenders landing space. That’s not a talent. He got fouled on a couple of them but to act like flopping is skill is something only a Rocket fan does

"Look, most of these errors are coming from people wanting to multiply before dividing & that’s a rookie mistake because even though multiplication comes before division in PEMDAS, they’re both treated the same, hence why you’re only getting the correct answer when dividing 1st https://twitter.com/ThatsSonny/status/1125065645006237698 …"
9
"I got one at first because I forgot that multiplication & division are treated the same when it comes to PEMDAS; so after I remembered that I was like LOL it’s 9 :) so yeah. The way this problem is set up, it’s meant to trick you if you fail to remember the true rules of PEMDAS."
I keep shifting my attention one minute to the Met Gala & the next minute to the Astros
"It’s 9, did you not read what I just said explaining why it’s 9 and not 1"
"Literally ready to fight the trio of you, @ccross101 & @topher_214 over this because YOU GUYS OBVIOUSLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND UGH BOYS!!!"
Lord... you too? Y’all are visibly exhibiting that alllll of y’all don’t truly know the rules of PEMDAS.
"No it isn’t y’all are making a rookie mistake. -.-  Y’all are multiplying because you know the M comes before the D in PEMDAS but you’re failing to remember that you have to read it from left to right, & multiplication & division hold the same power so if division comes 1st..."
You must divide before multiplying in this case scenario. This problem is quickly weeding out the people who don’t know the true rules of PEMDAS!
"It does BUT YOU ARE ALL FAILING TO REALIZE / LEARN / REMEMBER that multiplication & division rank equally so you have to go left to right, hence why you must divide first.  I am sick of y’all."
YOU ARE WRONG OKAY NICK
"If that’s your argument that’s funny, you’re just proving to me there aren’t many bright headed individuals 😇 and that’s okay :)"
Pains me to know I’m friends with people who truly believe that the answer is 1.

The girls who tweet the most positive shit on Twitter are the girls with the negative comments on people’s tweets under the replies.
Be careful telling Twitter that they’ll all tell you how shitty it looks and have nothing but negative comments towards it

Well if it doesn’t I don’t want it
I hate that I work with apparel bc I never want to fold my clothes at home after doing it all damn day 🤦🏽‍♀️

Have a good steam buddy. I'm working today so I can't stop by.
That's an excellent way to look at it. That's all I can ever do and will always do is be friendly.
That's the crappy part but what I can say is keep being you and don't let that change. Trust me when I say I feel jaded sometimes as this is a thing in my career as well.
I just looked up funny in Twitter gifs and that was the first to pop up. Destiny!!!
"Awe I hope you feel better. Get some rest, eat and drink water!!"
Man so many tweets I've deleted due to errors plus the regretted ones. If that was a trackable number it'd be more than tweets out there.
Good morning!!
Well said. Do any and everything without expectations.   The only expectations you should have is that of yourself.
That's amazing. Great work.
I've just been playing video games since I was a little boy back in the 80s.   What about you?
Good morning!!
 pic.twitter.com/IxZSOHQZg6
I do remember the first game I played on Atari and it was a Star Wars one. You flew a snow speeder and you were fighting the walkers. And then Pitfall. Oh man. Nostalgia
I'm always on Twitter. Never stop!!
I've never heard of this and I'm a fan of the Evil Deads.
I might be getting this!!!
It's all about how I let it affect me. I've decided that even when it frustrates me I'm going to use that fuel to feed my fire to stream more. I can't stop now. I'm just stating to rebuild myself again.
You're welcome. Live setting Oriole create their own things. Gives it a little more personalization and a real insight to the actual person. I've been messing around with my own stuff but I'm not very creative or very good.
Doing well. Just started a 48 hour shift. Twitter is about to be blown up with me!!  How about you?
I'm going to have to download this and watch it.
Oh. I bet breakfast is something that we're could agree on with food. What you getting?   And have fun in class.
I love pancakes!!
This is what I what I was thinking but I've just started to rebuild myself back up. I'm going to try a few other things before I decide to stop completely.   Thank you for your input. Really means a lot.
@pepsi is way better than @CocaColaCo. I can even drink Pepsi warm.
I think we all could use a genuine friend.
Well let me shoot you a DM.
Always an amazing day. Hope your's is as amazing!!!!!!!!
Let's go!
Yes. Finally a common ground and we don't have to fight anymore.   To be honest though I like the fight.
That's what I've been doing on my other account to.
I don't use anything but my own hashtag anymore. I'm done with hashtags.   #TheBandits #BanditLove
I hate phones.
Not how I see mine. Working all weekend.
Yes. I've said this numerous times. It's your own opinion that matters at the end of the day. Make it a good one.
It's not a bad thing to be hard on yourself. That just means you have high standards for yourself. Just make sure those standards are realistic and obtainable.
I've got my next idea for my fifth emote. Now just have to wait till they open that slot up. Or maybe just hold off on my 4th and put it as 5th.
You are you're worst critique.
I can link you to mine. She's the only one I'll use for emotes.
Oh man. I've never seen anything like that though but it does sound very enticing.
Peanut butter and BlackBerry jelly!! Yes baby.
Happy birthday mom!!
Oh man! Oh man!!
Butts are better.
Its been commissioned. Not sure when I'll but I'm thinking about moving the heart and putting it there. Not really sure. I'll let you guys choose when I get it and dfi a reveal.
Dang nurses!! You all are wild anyways.
I can't stand it when someone digs in their belly button. Makes me cringe so bad.
I know. I love my artist. She's super amazing. Also I love doing reveals. Only one person knows the idea to the emote because she gave me the idea.
Have a great stream.
You're so weird!! I mean how could you not mind someone digging in their belly buttons.   Just kidding.  Belly buttons are the portal to the soul.
The store I was at earlier. pic.twitter.com/bRsw4xMJwp
Dang!!!!
Who wouldn't want to do that? I would love to live in between some bobbies.
That's wonderful to hear. I tried to stop by. I'll have to catch you next time.
Are you entertained yet?
Oh baby. Give me a few and I'll shoot a DM.
Yes yes yes. I'll shoot you a DM very shortly.
I'll be shooting everyone a DM here very shortly. This is going to fun!!
I sent a dm to all in the comments at this moment. I want to add you all to a group chat to get this accomplished sti we're are on the same page.
I'll shoot a DM.
Dm incoming!!
A smile is sexy. Let's all wear one today!!
Don't let negativity control your emotions. We are all better than that. Smile baby!!
"All day, everyday!!"
Hope you have an amazing birthday homie!!! https://twitter.com/tehhellhound666/status/1110126443214917632 …
Oh you should just do it. It was the best experience ever. The day I graduated basic training I jumped out of a plane.  Not really a bucket list thing but something I want to do again is scuba diving.
Awwww. This is gonna make everyone's day!!
Oh man. Right in the feels. I'm so happy to have met you as well. Such an amazing person you are!!
 pic.twitter.com/DLV7QU8qVJ
Yeah cave diving would be amazing.
I hope they do to as well. No I'm not. I'm working today as well.
The year of many possibilities!!
One of my passions is helping people that is why I'm still in the career field I'm in. It's not the reason I chose this career path though.   And I love to dance. I'm all time white boy chair dancer!!

It will be soon. Letting mine grow to at least my birthday.
How can you not wake up to the lights coming on and a loud tone?
Maybe not that long.
I used to have hair as long or maybe even longer than you
I'm a light sleeper so a mouse farting in the night wakes me.
Oh. I'm gonna have to start looking into this.
We'll see in about 6 months.
Some before then after?
I don't do selfies very well though.
But I only have internet friends. That's why I'm always on Twitter.
Well that's no good.
Oh. That works.
Too smart you are
Let's go goofball!! Hope your stream is going well.
Hey
You beautiful fools. Have fun!!
I wish I wasn't at work so I could come and enjoy your shenanigans!! Hope you're having an amazing stream
"I feel pretty Oh, so pretty I feel pretty and witty and bright And I pity Any girl who isn't me tonight"
Sure thing. Give me just a little bit and I'll send you a DM.
Oh yeah baby. I shoot you a DM shortly.
Let's go. I'll get you a DM very shortly.
I like it. DM incoming shortly.
Alright homie! I'll send you a DM in just a little bit.
Don't want to be too nosey so hopefully it all works out for you.
Make genuine connections with people. Remember people come and go but if you have that genuine connection when they return that hype will be there.
Ha. Well you can be a messy ass good like. I'll shoot you a DM here shortly.
You two are one of the most genuine people I've met among others. I love the energy you two show for each other and your viewers. Much love to the both of you.

just bc someone gets paid to clean up at places doesn’t mean you need to just not throw your trash away in trashcans. I can’t stand when people say “its their job to clean.”

We all know of more people who have faced ALS than we may think. Let’s take a look at some famous faces that have been affected starting with Lou Gehrig. Here you can see some of Mr. Gehrig’s statistics while he played baseball. It’s clear why he was called The Iron Horse! pic.twitter.com/rThBJ1SjDM
Another famous victim of Lou Gehrig’s Disease is one that many of us know. Professor Stephen Hawking was a graduate from Oxford and also one of the few people to outlive ALS’s 5-7 year life expectancies.

Wrong.
It’s not you guys it’s public record for all the world to see. I like how you just come up with stuff out of thin air like the dog catcher to distract.I don’t care about Trump it could be Hillary. When you have FBI out to get you and they say it in their damn text. It’s not right
Yes and nothing happen. You need to put your hate for Trump aside like Mueller did  and you will find there is not enough to charge him with anything. That is WHY They did not charge him. It’s done move on.  You can still hate him and vote.
No Hillary did that all by herself.
No actual facts Mueller found nothing to charge Trump on and the Dems are still on a witch hunt.

Fucking preach.
I agree. As a Christian I oppose abortion for killing innocent babies and also I oppose the death penalty because our system may be killing one or two or more innocent people. I find it curious that so many people camp out in one and not the other.
I tuck it in because I don’t want my underwear showing as it does not look good. It has nothing to do with causing anyone to stumble. My youth leader never mentioned this.
I wonder if Barr read the 7 million pages in the evidence or the 700 page summary of the Mueller report.
I believe that using unnecessary words and the same ones over and over again shows lack of self- control.
My experience has shown me that in most cases parents are the best teachers for their 0-4 year old children. I am thankful for every family that can achieve this. Good and affordable often are mutually exclusive when it comes to child care.
Does he know it is about a million pages long and that the summary is 700 pages long? I sincerely doubt that Barr did not.
This statement is illogical and racist.
You might want to go back and check your biology book on this one. It is sperm that fertilizes and egg which begins a life. It can do nothing on it is own.
When watching CNN I have seen her name often as well.
I found a study with a very small sample that shows black test taking rose to level of others during Obama ‘s nomination and victory. NYT “Study sees an Obama Effect as Lifting Black Test Takers” 2009.
Don’t worry CNN has got this covered on Trump.
"I believe schools help you educate your children, and not that schools educate your children for you."
People choose to make a day of remembrance for strange bits of history. In Bolivia they used to have a day of to remember the day they lost their land that gave Bolivia access to the sea in lost battles. This was a truly sad day for their economy.
This looks suspiciously staged. The way the camera was focused several seconds before the first policeman arrives. The second policeman looks like he was stepping over the man to get to other side. What happened before this and where is the audio?
I am not afraid of people in prison voting. They are in prison because they have done something that shows they are not willing to abide by our cultures rules of living and workjng together. As a result they lose their right to participate in making those rules and electing.
I would like for all women and men to vote thoughtfully instead of according to some group. Just because a group is for Warren is not my reason to vote for her. I will personally read about her and her stances on the issues and decide fot myself.
I understand that the law is changing regarding pot possession.
It is shocking to see this is being taught anywhere and that anyone would consider a growing baby like a cancer. Ask women around you if they would prefer to have cancer over a baby if they “had the choice”.
The US is higher than many other countries in mother mortality in childbirth.  This is partially due to the high number of Caesarian sections. I believe any politician should aim at making childbirth safer for every woman.
I agree. This is dangerous. Please remember that not all “churches” are alike.
"Agreed. In some ways, we have become too tolerant."
Did you know that Robert E. Lee was influential in convincing the south to quit fighting and join the Union? That he never owned a slave or a house. He got Washington University going again after the war ( now called Washington and Lee) .
Any student that said or did say thing prejudicial against blacks was dismissed from the school. I think that it is what Robert E. Lee did after he was on the wrong side of the war which makes him memorable.
"I guess you neglected to read my last two tweets. His actions AFTER the war helped pull our country together again. Can a person be wrong in their choice and later make a good  choice? Of course, we know many who have done just that."
Wow! There seems to be a lot of hate there. But there is also exaggeration. We are all just people with differing views.
"But not Robert E Lee’s. He never owned a slave. He was in the war for state’s rights. Yes, that did mean he was fighting to keep slaves. His actions after the war show the kind of man he became and the good he did all around him."
"I am pretty sure that given the choice to live and try to live a happy life or be killed en utero, all children would choose their turn at life."
"No, actually music reminds me of a happy time related to that song. There is no mind control going on at all. Love God, love others. It is pretty simple really."
In the education system ED means Emotional Disability. Be careful with using just letters because they can have a lot of differing meanings.
Your generalizations are clearly from personal bias.
I looked up “mystical manipulation”. It is when divine authority or spiritual advancement allows the leader to re- interpret events as he/she wishes or make prophesies for the purpose of controlling others.”
"I have been a Christian for a long time, gone to churches in many countries and have not seen mystical manipulation. If the “leader” does not follow the New Testsment and live like it and is inclined to more money they are not a leader in most evangelical churches."
I say “most” because I have not been to all” and so cannot give info about all. What you speak of sounds more like a David Koresh thing.
"Christian music is calming and joyful. It reminds me of our powerful, yet loving and merciful God."
"Although the current president is lacking many things regarding social and presidential mores, he did not move into the White House early but followed tradition in that. He recognizes bankruptcy when it occurs."
I am so sorry that it has come to this.
That might be the best way for you to think to get rid of the cognitive dissonance you experience when it is so easy to see Him in creation. I too do not know the answer to every question. Yet I do see that He has given us freedom to choose . He could have made us robots.
Then you were thinking too hard.
Or the reverse how often do environmentalists work with hunters on environmental issues.
"Yes, I have thought through many things. You choose a bad outcome by not believing in Him. He gives you a way out. As the other ones people worship , they offer no answer to evil and sin. Their God does not love them or offer any relationship. I have thought a lot about it."
Read their readings.
I am a conservative. These are my second lines to your first. 1. We want lives saved. 2. We would like it legal but called by another name. 3. We don’t know what to do about illegal immigration. 4. We want to avoid extremists. 5. How do we train them for upcoming military stress?
One more. 7. Ban semi-automatic and automatic weapons and bump stocks.
This is just wrong.

Anyone else just think about how much you really want it?
The 12 tickets I have pre ordered for my friends and I to go see #EndGame over at @Cinemark this Friday at midnight are putting me on edge.. I’m so ready for these 3 hours with my friends. I’m ready to feel all my emotions as I watch this 10 year story come to a final.
Life is simple at times. Hold onto that.
"Hopefully everyone had a good weekend. So, I Came to Texas on vacation and ended up on Death 💀 Row....JK Here is “Old ⚡️ Sparky.” The old TX electric chair at the TX Prison Museum in Huntsville. It was great chatting w/some men/women of the TX Dept of Corrections. #StaySafe pic.twitter.com/GKR7tqtF3q"

"Our coverage of the John William King execution began here in Huntsville last night. He is scheduled to die by lethal injection shortly after 6 p.m. Wednesday. King is known as the “ringleader” for the hate crime of James Byrd Jr., who was brutally killed in 1998. #12NewsNow pic.twitter.com/yJl6nZ6I46 – at Huntsville ""Walls"" Unit"
"It’s a quiet scene right now outside the Huntsville “Walls” Unit. Employees have begun to trickle in and out of the facility. John William King, 44, will be transported here later today and will be the second person involved in James Byrd Jr.’s murder to be executed. #12NewsNow pic.twitter.com/8fVQoOsPp7"
"The other being Lawrence Russell Brewer, 44, who was executed by lethal injection in 2011. The third person convicted in Byrd’s death is Shawn Berry, who is serving life in prison."

"Strong words from Clara Taylor (James Byrd Jr.’s sister) last night following the execution of John William King, 44.

So lmao I cried today after pumping gas😭😂😂
Me
Highlight of the day so far: I am currently getting a pizza for my lunch even though I get off work in an hour
All I did at work was tweet and one full highlight
Guys I want to get my hair cut up to my collar bone today
I got high and ate all my gushers the other day. Now sober abi wants gushers but doesn’t have gushers money.
I’ve been in bed literally all day but not that it’s 10pm I’m ready to go out and do stuff
At this point idk if my back hurts because of work or the way I sleep or I don’t drink enough water or I need a chiropractor or I’m pregnant. Let’s hope it’s the work/sleep thing.
"Unless I can pull 10 points out of my ass on a lab, I’m not gonna pass my physics class and I’m having a mental breakdown right now."
"Y’all. I gotta get a 100% on an exam makeup, and 80% on the final for the class MINIMUM to pass. I’m going to be nose in the books for a while so if I ain’t answering saying no or whatever, don’t be upset."
Can I relate anymore to another tweet? Probably not. https://twitter.com/arihahamid/status/1115991901566636033 …
It’s possible. If not def check out shein. May find something close.
This guy just walked into my physics class late as hell singing a song. Professor paid no mind. He’s still singing.
Just want DQ before I go to work. At this rate I’ll be starving till around 530.
Salon shut down for an hour and a half due to no power. Left and then had to turn around and come back up. If we don’t get at least one person tonight I swear on my life I will quit.
Feels good knowing everything due today is done and turned in. Now I gotta write a whole other essay by Wednesday at 9AM😁

Literally just let this man pull up so he could do my hw. I’ve peaked.
UPDATE: he doesn’t think the sun is a star🙃

How can someone who doesn’t know a fucking thing about me and my struggles tell me I’m not going anywhere and not trying hard enough and then apologize after I tell them they don’t know shit expect me to forgive them? This is fucking ridiculous.
At least I can get @Whataburger so I can be happy https://twitter.com/abi_christinee/status/1119760054842986497 …

Especially after a 14 hour shift
BITCH STUPID 😂😂

Laying in bed after a long day of work when your legs are cramping and you’re thinking about how you have to be up in 5 hours to work another 13 hour shift...
You know how good it feels to lay in bed after a 60 hour work week knowing you have tomorrow off 😭😩❤️
"Sorry, that’s my position..🤣"
You know I got you too 😂
I feel like I just hate life. 👌🏻🙂
I feel accomplished 🙂
after nap motivation wya
s/o to my mf self
I miss my grandma . I have so much to talk about . She would be giving me a thumbs up rn
It’s crazy how once I got a new job all the ones I applied to 3+ wks ago are just now responding to me
really caught a flat otw to work 😑 wow
Feels like I’m getting ahold of things . Just taking a different route than I planned #PostGradLife
thinking of my next weekend vaca 🤔
Huntsville cleaners be making they money off us who work for the state man
"I’m not gon lie I like when orgs sell they plates at functions . I’m quick to cash app that 5,6 or $7 especially if I coming from a work"
People gon learn once 10pm hit my phone automatically goes on DND & shortly after I’m sleep . No one gets a response
I look at Sorors neophyte presentations from around the world on snap chat & think my region/grad chapter/advisor would NEVER let us do what I see lmao
"Jessie and I slept until 7:45 this morning , we did good today ."
I have no purpose being awake rn
mood : pic.twitter.com/JyCx2Shl7o
neeeeedddd my hair done
Or how someone attended their event . People can attend events and not be interested in Greek life . Maybe they’re supporting a friend or like the org in general 🤷🏽‍♀️ but I digress 😂 https://twitter.com/ImKayluhh/status/1110549185777020928 …
I never realized how much I enjoyed wearing my hair down and until I got a job where I can’t at all
Sammy Palooza look dead on snap like no one is engaged at all Lmaaaaooooo
I think I get more excited ordering gifts then the person receiving them
grocery shopping took all my energy
excited to move & actually decorate because I’m not moving again for a while lol
exhausted with life
I think it’s time to stop avoiding going back to school especially when I have most of the classes already .
Bed never felt so good 😭
Jessie let me sleep in until 9 this morning 🙌🏽
this rain tho pic.twitter.com/HdJwQHRqvd
I’ve been to too many probates where the org sings the Greek Alphabet . Is that a new trend that’s starting ? Because I don’t think that’s it .
Look at my Club 💙 https://twitter.com/0v0_marsalis/status/1115075913543188481 …

what a long annoying ass day .
Anybody know a nail place in Huntsville that does ombré really good ? 👀
My roommate is anemic and she turns the air all the way off . Baby girl I’m a plus size girl I need air
The only way you get to pick my nail color is if you’re paying .
Found that place & I’m satisfied . https://twitter.com/alexis_murrayx/status/1115750131410853888 …

Are you willing to go through things to get to what you prayed for??
Idk why I’ve been waking up around the same time the past few days . Weird
The SGRho license plate I just ordered for Rocky 🔥
I miss having @theABefffect & @_ChrissyCouture here for dinner night followed by gallons of wine 😭 I need the hysterical laughs
Excuses are unattractive
you block your blessings when you hold on to the negative .
Had so much fun with my coworkers like wow who’d ever thought ???
Sometimes I hate how dominant & assertive I am
I need months worth of sleep in one nights rest
the weekend wasn’t long enough 😩
I can’t sleep because I’m hot 😤
I can’t wait to move out of these old broken down out dated ass apartments .
Honestly need to get back to taking care of myself better than I do now . My body is feeling it
Today I’m going to try my best not to nap after work so I can stop feeling like shit the next day ☹️
The amount of gas I have saved & miles  on my car since I changed jobs has been drastic .
Thankful & Blessed 💞
Sleeping in a deep conditioner after having braids gave my hair all the TLC
I was full force about going back to school in the fall & since I’ve been accepted that thrill isn’t there anymore
I got a lot accomplished today & it felt good to not be on a time schedule
The next person that shoots their shot at me because they think I like girls I’m going to give them my gay friends number . I’m match maker at this point
I can’t decide if I want to plan a trip in the states or go lay on the beach somewhere
best freakin nap eeeveerrrrrr

HAPPY BIRTHDAY OLD MAN!!!! ❤️❤️@lechi_laFlame
This nap I’m finna take>>>>
Yup I’m ready to debate
I definitely think she was entitled to some things he took all her money and I get u should stick by ur man but that was a loonngggg time and sis was tired of having to take care of a GROWN MAN so ion blame her then for him to go to the woman he told her not to worry about🙁
Exactly and I believe she was entitled to it... now the extra I agree she was crazy but she deserved the money and the house
She did believe in him that’s why she gave him all that money and her mothers house and for how ever many years she worked all these jobs and provided for their family she was TIRED
I’m not saying I agree to the whole $10 mil but I’m saying she does deserve her money back
Like I said I’m not saying I agree with everything she did but I do believe she was entitled to some reparations
and sis was hurt you would be too if the man you were in love with left you for someone else and gave her the exact things he said he would give you... and she felt dumb cause she knew she shouldn’t have left him so she acted crazy
I agree...
Not left her but didn’t come back to her if that makes sense I worded that wrong
Ik I look better🤷🏾‍♀️😂
Tbh tay😂 and gon head he or she may need to know😂💀
No really cauuuseee huhhh???

Doodlers Unite by @SunniBrown is great. About 15 min long. Talks about the importance of doodling.
"The way I’d approach the video would be to do what I call “after the fact” Sketchnoting. Have your audience take “regular” handwritten notes while they watch the video. Then, have them review the notes and then create their Sketchnote. This does two things."
It does 2 things. 1) takes the pressure off of creating the sketchnote while watching the video. 2) has them review the information they already captured in their notes and filter it for importance when deciding what to include in the Sketchnote.
After the fact Sketchnoting gives so many more interactions with the information. 1) taking traditional notes 2) reviewing notes to decide what to use in SN 3) the act of creating the Sketchnote itself. That’s 3 different interactions with info.
Usually we take notes and put them away never to look at them again. With after the fact they see the info and process it 3 times.
I just noticed you’re from broken arrow. Very cool. I grew up in Lawton and then moved to Norman. That’s where I did all my teaching/librarian-ing before moving to work at SHSU. Always nice to come across a fellow Okie.
You are mazing. I’m so proud of you.
I've lived in OK all my life. Even though I work at SHSU my husband still lives there so I commute every week.
I see Jenks as you location now. You teach there! My friend is a librarian there at a junior high.
Definitely.
❤️❤️❤️ Yes. We go way back. She also got her library degree from where I teach. @SHSULIBSCI I love her dearly. She is an amazing teacher/librarian.
Absolutely!!

"After a couple of days of playing through Smash post Joker DLC, I think I've concluded that Challenger Pack 1 with Joker, Mementos and songs from P3-5 is the best DLC content we've received for any Smash game."
"First of all Joker plays beautifully (new main watch out). But the references and love Sakurai has given the Persona franchise is great. Atlus has reciprocated the love by putting music from not only P5 but 3 and 4 too. Wow, thank you."
I state that specifically because the next best character inclusion was Cloud in Smash 4. But it was kinda sketchy. Square Enix only gave us two songs for the entire FF franchise... It's great to see Atlus giving love to Smash as a third party.
"Other than that, everything about pack 1 is fantastic. I can't wait to see who they pick next. My guess is Erdrick, Sora (if he's not next it's never happening ever), or Banjo. Please be Banjo I'll actually cry."

it controls everything & no matter how much we try we sometimes don't realize that our period is controlling our emotions we think we're going crazy . me personally I was crying uncontrollably for a week & then my period started & realized that was why https://twitter.com/Bstroke17/status/1110592296603525123 …
@Bstroke17 like my mom is almost 40 & it still messes with her emotions . & it also messes with our bodies . it makes me bloated like crazy ! it's a roller coaster . it's literally hell
i'm ngl sometimes you can control it but sometimes even knowing you on yo period you have no control over how you feel it's a hard situation to be in not being able to control that cuz like you said you would think we would be able to but everybody different
I like the fact you actually trynna understand the situation thoo . rather than assuming that we can control everything when we on our periods . very appreciated
but you trying to understand & honestly that's all that matters. because you don't go through it so I wouldn't expect you to get it but you're trying .
lmfaooooo 😂😂😂 no fr

Elvis buddy are we gonna swing the bat today or just look at 3 straight fastballs down the pipe?
The difference of this game is that Oakland can actually hit with runners on and Texas can’t

Please make it stop https://twitter.com/NEISD/status/1120684550487777283 …
If the rangers could just hit with runners in scoring position that would be nice
Ok this is epic https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/1121149771849191426 …
Joey is getting screwed by these umps today
"Ok Joey showed some major restraint right there, that’s 3 straight at bats where the ump had K’d him up on a ball... ridiculous."

"It literally feels like I’m watching a Little league game rn Hearn can’t throw strikes and we can’t catch a damn foul ball, this is ridiculous."
And I turned down a contract to play for the Rangers https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1121468176716500997 …
I don’t know how much longer I can stay awake for this Rangers game so if we could just win it here in the 11th that would be nice
Definitely would be more excited for a Trump/Bernie showdown https://twitter.com/LisaBritton/status/1121787803665256448 …
I never understood why baseball fans feel the need to give a standing ovation to a pitcher that just absolutely sucked on the mound.
What an honor it was to see @MarcusLuttrell throw out the first pitch at today’s game 🇺🇸
Alright rangers let’s finish this series above .500 #TogetherWe
"29 runs for the rangers in two games, when we are playing well no one can beat us"
Choo has to be the best lead off man in baseball
WHY IS ODOR HITTING IN THE 2 HOLE
